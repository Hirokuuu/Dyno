# 🔐 Dyno Systems – Next-Gen Dynamic Payment Card Security

**Dyno Systems** is a revolutionary card solution that eliminates the vulnerabilities of traditional payment cards by removing static card data and implementing real-time dynamic tokenization. Our solution is designed to fight card theft, reduce fraud, and cut operational costs for banks and consumers alike.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Dyno is a secure, numberless card that relies on dynamic, rotating card numbers and CVVs. With no visible information on the card itself and secure token generation through a connected app or embedded chip, Dyno makes stolen data useless to hackers.

* No printed card number or CVV
* Dynamic numbers that change regularly
* App-based token generation for online and in-person use
* Faster card reissuance and lower fraud rates

## 📊 Why Dyno?

| Feature                  | Traditional Cards | Virtual Cards | **Dyno Systems** |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Static PAN/CVV           | ✅                 | ❌             | ❌                |
| Tokenized Transactions   | ❌                 | ✅             | ✅                |
| Physical Card Usability  | ✅                 | ❌             | ✅                |
| Numberless Physical Card | ❌                 | ✅             | ✅                |
| Dynamic CVV/PAN          | ❌                 | ✅             | ✅                |

## 💰 Potential Impact

* **60% reduction in card fraud** (Visa)
* **\$65K–\$130K savings annually** for a 100,000-card portfolio
* **\$5–\$20** saved per card not needing reissuance (ABA)
* Reduced logistical and operational costs for banks

## 🛡️ How It Works

1. **Token Generation**: Unique transaction tokens are generated per use.
2. **Rotating Identifiers**: Card numbers and CVVs are never static.
3. **App Integration**: Secure mobile app displays active card info.
4. **Offline Security**: Physical card carries no usable info without token.
